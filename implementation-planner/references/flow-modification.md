# Feature Modification Flow (A → B)

1. Ask for **keywords** to speed up discovery
2. **Run Discovery Phase** (focus: current implementation, callers, test coverage)
3. Describe **current logic** → wait for approval
4. Describe **target logic** → wait for approval
5. Produce implementation plan:
   - Tasks with dependencies
   - Parallel tasks identified
   - **Note relevant files/code areas** for each task
