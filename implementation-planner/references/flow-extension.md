# Feature Extension Flow (Add C)

1. Ask for **keywords** to speed up discovery
2. **Run Discovery Phase** (focus: extension points, existing interfaces, contracts)
3. Describe **current logic** → wait for approval
4. Determine:
   - New entities needed?
   - New functions to add?
   - New behavior description
5. Wait for approval
6. Produce implementation plan:
   - Tasks with dependencies
   - Parallel tasks identified
   - **Note relevant files/code areas** for each task
