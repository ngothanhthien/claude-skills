# New Feature Flow

1. Ask for **keywords** (feature terms, packages/libraries to use)
2. **Run Discovery Phase** (focus: similar features, data models, API patterns)
3. Propose **ERD** (entities/relationships) → wait for approval
4. Identify **use cases** → wait for approval
5. Produce implementation plan:
   - Tasks broken down
   - Parallel tasks marked with `[PARALLEL]`
   - Dependencies explicit: `depends_on: [task_id]`
   - Business logic focus (pseudocode max)
